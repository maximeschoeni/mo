      note: `At the Opening Ceremony of the Vancouver 2010 Games, members of the Four Host First Nations greeted the crowd and the world in their respective languages, as well as in English and French. Dancers from major Aboriginal societies in other parts of Canada then danced during the parade of athletes.

The ceremonial or traditional clothing of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada - sometimes called "regalia" - has great spiritual significance for its wearer and for those invited to the ceremony where it is worn. They may represent sacred heritage dating back to revered ancestors, others may have spiritual significance directly related to the person wearing them.

This explains why these costumes are replicas specially created for the Olympic Museum and not those worn during the ceremony.

This proposal is part of a return to basics since in Antiquity, cultural competitions rubbed shoulders with sporting events.
Art competitions were therefore organized for the first time during the Games in 1912 and continued until 1948. They gave rise to the awarding of medals, like sports events.

The series of three paintings "Studies of sport", ("Corner", "Departure" and "Rugby") by Jean Jacoby (1891-1936) won the gold medal.

The Luxembourg artist Jean Jacoby also won the gold medal in 1928, and participated in the competitions of 1932 and 1936.

With their medals in the women's team sprint at the Rio Games in 2016, Gong Jinhie and Zhong Tianshi won the first Chinese gold medal in the history of Olympic cycling.

The Incolor workshop in Guangzhou, southern China in the province of Guangdong, designed and created their helmets.
"Our helmets are hand-painted and are as special and unique to us as winning a gold medal at the Olympics," said Zhang Dongliang, chief designer at Incolor.

Gong Jinjie's helmet represents the legendary heroine Mu Guiying. Brave, resolute and loyal, Mu is a cultural symbol of the steadfast woman.
Zhong Tianshi's helmet is illustrated with the face of Hua Mulan, a strong woman and a brave warrior who replaced her elderly father to join the army.

In Amsterdam in 1928, he won the bronze medal in middleweight freestyle wrestling.

A complete artist, he also sang, painted, drew and taught. His knowledge of the sport allows him to effectively convey the movement and tension of the game.

The works of Samuel Rabin are relatively rare. Indeed, very perfectionist, he destroyed several, which he did not find satisfactory. Also, during the war, a number of canvases were accidentally destroyed by his landlady.

The challenges were traveling trophies, cups or sculptures, which the winners undertook to return before the following Games and which were then given to the next winner.
They had been offered to the IOC by wealthy personalities of the time, such as Tsar Nicolas II of Russia, the Duke of Sparta (future King Constantine 1st of Greece), the German Emperor William II, King Victor-Emmanuel III of Italy etc. They testify to the importance of Pierre de Coubertin's social circle and the growing importance of the Olympic Games in European high society.

This challenge was created and won in 1908 pby Charles Bartlett. It is one of the eight challenges distributed in 1908 and the only one of royal provenance.
As the 100km cycling race was not repeated in 1912, the Organizing Committee for the Stockholm Games then requested authorization to use this challenge for the 300km on the road, which was refused by the British Olympic Association. The challenge was thus able to be kept by Charles Bartlett before the Olympic Museum found the opportunity to acquire it.

Emilia Rotter (1906-2003) is a Hungarian figure skater. Her partner in a relationship was László Szollás (1907-1980). They have been European champions and four times world champions. They also won two bronze medals at the Olympics in 1932 and 1936.

The destinies of Emilia Rotter and László Szollás are very dark. While several members of the Rotter family were killed in concentration camps during World War II, Emilia alone managed to survive.
As for László Szollás, he fought on the Eastern Front, was captured by the Soviet army and was a prisoner of war in Siberia for three years.

The violence of the impact is evident when looking at the marks on Dudley Stokes' helmet.

Their story was featured in the movie "Rasta Rockett" / "Cool Runnings" in 1993.

Drawing on the principles that allow a South American butterfly, the Morpheus, to change color, Morphotex fiber uses refracted sunlight rather than dyes to produce a range of colors that vary with changes in light.

Eiko Ishioka's work on film productions like Paul Schrader's 'Mishima', Francis Ford Coppola's 'Dracula' and Tarsem Singh's 'The Cell' was dark and poignant. Working with Descente and radical.media, a a New York multimedia production company, she approached this "much sunnier challenge" that is the Olympics with her usual professional standards. "I thought about the camera on the athletes as they held up a medal of 'or (...) It's the same attitude I had when designing 'Dracula' or 'The Cell'. The goal is to delight the public".

In the segment titled "Swing Out Sister," Danny Boyle paid tribute to the National Health Service. Nurses pushed 100 children lying in their hospital beds there. A dozen large beds containing characters from British children's books then arrived in the arena. These puppets depicted a world tour of fictional villains including Cruella de Vil and Captain Hook and then, from the center of the stadium, emerged 40ft tall Lord Voldemort, the evil wizard of the Harry Potter books. But evil was struck down and darkness banished when 30 Mary Poppins descended into the arena, armed with their umbrellas.

On the Seine at Argenteuil, Beijnen and Rösingh opposed the French. During the final, the two boats were tied for a long time. But 200 meters from the finish, the two Dutch rowers launched into a sprint which earned them victory.
This was celebrated with champagne offered by the losers.

In 1928 Antonie Christiaan Beijnen also participated in the Olympic Games in Amsterdam with the team of eight. Subsequently, a car enthusiast, he took part twice in the Monte Carlo Rally.
During the Second World War, he was resistant and hid English soldiers in his own attic, which was particularly courageous when you consider that three floors of his house were used by the Wehrmacht!

The "J.A. Van der Vegte", named after a participant in the Antwerp 1920 Games, was used for a very long time by the university rowing club Laga de Delft. He was going to be burned when he was able to be saved thanks to a fundraiser. The wooden hull has been restored to its original appearance. The boat was then presented at the World Championships at the Rotsee (Lucerne) in 1994 and donated to the Olympic Museum.

      note: `In 1968 for the Winter Olympics in Grenoble and in 1972 for the Summer Games in Munich, the first mascots appeared: Shuss and Waldi.
They were a success from the outset, as evidenced by the many derivative objects bearing their effigy, as well as the sales figures: two million Waldis were sold in 20 countries.


The creator of Shuss said in an interview: "My decision was made, the symbol of the 1968 Winter Olympics would be a young, kind and dynamic character, inspired by the famous French method, this coiled style, this egg-shaped position approaching the fetal position. Combining strength with speed, evoking dynamism in a static attitude, that was the problem I was asking myself. This is how, in the last hours of the night, the little figure with the head of a dragon was born. egg carried by the zigzagging lightning of its sole foot."

Waldi was born out of a collective effort:
“Waldi was born on December 15, 1969. Willi Daume (president of the Organizing Committee) had invited the members of the team to a Christmas party. There were pencils, pens and notebooks ready to give birth to an Olympic mascot. The result ? Different attempts to draw a discobolus or other such figures. And a dachshund that could barely be recognized as such. But he got the first prize because everyone loved him so much."

The judges left for lunch while Stukelj and his colleagues left to visit Versailles. Returning to Paris in the evening, one of the Czechoslovakian gymnasts said to him: "You're pretty good." "Why do you say that," Stukelj then asked. "Apparently you're on the front page of Le Matin," replied his rival. Stukelj and his companions rushed to a newsstand to check the news: Stukelj was first; Robert Prazak and Bedrik Supcik, both from Czechoslovakia were second and third.

Štukelj also competed at the 1928 and 1936 Games, where, at the age of 37, he won a silver medal on the rings, bringing his Olympic record to six medals.

In 1992, at the age of 93, Štukelj attended the opening ceremony of the Barcelona Games where he was able to see the Slovenian athletes parade for the first time behind their own flag.
Four years later, the Atlanta Opening Ceremony honored him, and he thrilled the crowd with his dynamic 97 years. He died four days before his 101st birthday.
